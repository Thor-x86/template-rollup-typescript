## Question & Answer

### Why is the formatting weird? I don't like tabs!

You can freely modify the `.prettierrc` and `.editorconfig` files to suit your style. To update all of your files, run this command

```bash
pnpm run format
```

### Why several files won't show on Git server?

Check `.gitignore` file and do commit the changes with git

### Some of files are missing after being downloaded to NPM server

Check `.npmignore` file and do publish again

### NPM/PNPM said that the version is not supported

Go to `package.json` and modify the "engines" part to your intended minimum NodeJS & NPM version

### How to modify GitHub Workflows behavior?

Go to `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` then change according to the [documentation][13]
